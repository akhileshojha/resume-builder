1. PROJECT Enhancements

   • Form Validation: Integrate form validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly. Use libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for robust form validation.
   • Local Storage: Use local storage to save form data, allowing users to return and continue where they left off.
   • Export to PDF: Consider integrating a PDF generation library like react-pdf to allow users to download their resume directly from the Preview page.
   • State Management: If your app grows more complex, consider using a state management library like Redux or Zustand.

Summary of All Components

You now have the PersonalInfoForm, EducationForm, ExperienceForm, SkillsForm, and ProjectsForm components all set up with validation using react-hook-form and yup. Each form component:

	1.	Uses react-hook-form to handle form state and validation.
	2.	Leverages yup schemas for defining and enforcing validation rules.
	3.	Handles form submissions by invoking handleSubmit from react-hook-form.
	4.	Uses useFieldArray for managing dynamic fields in the EducationForm, ExperienceForm, and ProjectsForm components.

Next Steps

Now that you’ve implemented form validation, you can:

	1.	Integrate these forms into your Home component to collect data from the user.
	2.	Pass the collected data to the Preview component for rendering a preview of the resume.
	3.	Handle form submission and data management to save the data locally or send it to a backend if needed.
